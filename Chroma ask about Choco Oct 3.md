> Why has no one told Choco to back off from Dani? They already taken down multiple accounts of Dani's and keep replying to their posts even though Dani's boundaries are clear, is this not harassment what Choco is doing or is it all Dani's fault and Choco is a saint who can do no wrong?

#### **chromatheantishipper answered:**

We have and Choco just purposely ignores it because they're another looser on the internet that gets satisfaction from degrading others.

It's spelled loser, and the term fits all of you better than anyone else.

I don't need to respect someone who tells others to kill themselves.

Dani's boundaries don't matter when they fail to respect everyone else's, they love the attention they crave from leeching off my blog, or they'd block me and be quiet

Harassment goes both ways. If they don't want to be harassed back they can leave the internet. I'm not hearing about boundaries from someone who starts every problem with anyone they come across and cries wolf later.
