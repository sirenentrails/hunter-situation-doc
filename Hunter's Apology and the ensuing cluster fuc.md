            The apology post
            
      this is a work in progress
      
  please be patient, I am a minor
  
DISCLAIMER!!! 

Something important I need to say... 

> Yes I've hurt people, but I was still affected too, (suicidal thoughts, being hospitalized, having to take pills) so froggo, choco, and anyone else I name owes me an apology
> 
> you do not need to accept this apology, all I ask in return is that you leave me and my mutuals alone and never mention me on you blogs again, that goes for not responding to asks or DMS about me
> 
> if you ban my account despite me making an apology post that further proves that you don't care about me getting better, I'm sorry if that was phrased in a poorly that's just how I genuinely feel, you want an apology yet how am I supposed to do that when I have no time to make one + you do not care when choco bans my account that prohibits me from doing that? exactly

ANOTHER DISCLAIMER

That "callout" post isn't well made, although I did not look through it fully but what I have seen it's just posts and reblogs taken out of context, moments of me being mad and acting out on anger and using vent posts against me, that's not proof, if me being vulnerable is "proof" to you then you are a disgusting fucking person, extra points for mocking my suicidal tendencies, some things that were just like unnecessary and just like one really cringey thing I said lmao, which I will soon address if I ever get to like POST THIS LMFAO 

AND ANOTHER DISCLAIMER

you are not obligated to accept my apology, I mentioned this earlier, all I ask of you is to leave me alone and never mention me on your blogs again, all I ask, I'll even block you first so you don't have to do anything, but please, just block me and move on, do not drag any of my actions after you read this apology post because then you are genuinely the problem if you milk the situation for views

And please do not go after my Pinterest, I hold it very dear to my heart and will spiral if something bad happens to it, I worked hard for those followers and I'm sorry you had to insert yourself in a situation you don't know the full context of neither where you affected or have any say in it

THE LAST DISCLAIMER TRUST

I'm going off of sirens "callout" and some other things constel sent me, and if this gives any context, I have horrible memory, I need proof to jog my memory since everything is a blur, it's a dissociation problem nothing too out of the ordinary for me, and if I've missed anything just DM me about it or I'll probably just edit this frequently cause, like I said, do forget very easily

not everything will be in order, I'm making this late at night on a school night and this post will be subject to change and I just can't think of everything at the moment, it's a work in progress per sey, the full version will be edited in one by one I just genuinely need sleep and get energy to go to school, so consider this like part one until I continue later lmao 🤣

##### Pinterest drama

> I was 13 at the time and I was scared
> 
> the situation is over a year old
> 
> I thought a 24 year old was harassing me for no reason
> 
> looking back I don't think she's actually 6, everything she did was too...well made, too well calculated, I don't know how to describe it...and I don't trust her cousin and she could've been lying but I don't know I have her blocked and she probably wouldn't care anyways
> 
> I can't apologize for anything because like Kayla isn't on Pinterest anymore and no one here is affected sooo...??? 


Yeah to basically make a long story fucking short, Kayla is definitely not 6...definitely older, but no one will ever know the truth tbh...¯\_(ツ)/¯

like I said I cant apologize to anyone because none of you are affected by it and if I should apologize to anyone it should be Kayla who started everything and she's not on here soooo... 

I do want to formally apologize for the doxxing threat, I was scared and immature and acting out on my emotions at the time and I am sorry, but unfortunately Kayla is not here to uhm...view the apology? if you would phrase it like that

but I want you to know that there is a very big difference between hoping something happens to someone and actually doing it

just because I say I hope \[insert bad thing\] happens to you doesn't mean I'm going to do it, it's quite literally just wishful thinking and the equivalent of karma, like yeah I wish bad things would happen to you but I gotta wait for someone else to do it to you first not me

---

##### Suicide baiting

> If you think using vent posts as "proof" is credible or even professional in any capacity you are genuinely a horrible person who deserves nothing good in life, and I mean that wholeheartedly
>
> those were cries for help, I genuinely do not feel safe at home and I do genuinely struggle with suicidal thoughts/thoughts of running away, just because it's a vent post made by someone you like doesn't mean it's bait

This section doesn't need an apology rather an explanation/my thoughts on it, why I added it is to just give my opinion on why it's fucking disgusting to use vent posts against some and use posts made when someone is extremely vulnerable, it's disgusting and deplorable and downright insulting

---

##### Antishipvin situation

> He apologized yet what posses you to say shit like that??? 
>
> I wanted to see the good in him but he literally just went in then out under 72 hours so.... 
> 
> I don't know what to say this dude was...interesting...to say the least... 

Just like to preference the fact... 

I DO NOT SUPPORT SENDING RAPE TREATS, THAT'S INHUMANE AND DEPLORABLE, YOU ARE A LESSER HUMAN BEING IF YOU DO THAT

I just wanted to see the good in him given he was 13 but like when I was 13 I would never think of doing that but still??? I have nothing to say really, I don't remember the account name he said it to and idk if they'd accept an apology on my behalf, but they have interacted with me recently and they where nice so? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

---

##### Sexual harassment lies

> That ask wasn't sexual in anyway, choco lied and twisted my words to make me look bad and to further their victim complex
>
> I already apologized about it in the DMS and outside multiple times
> 
> the original context was that my dad told me we might go to Spain and since choco lives in Spain I made a bad joke implying we should meet up irl, as you can tell there was no sexual intentions behind the real context and choco simply lied to make me look bad :) 

Yet again, no need for an apology because choco lied and twisted my words, there was no sexual harassment or sexual meanings behind that ask, just a poorly done joke that I've already apologized for multiple times but choco ran out of reasons to not like me so they resorted to lying ;) 

---

##### Transohobe??? deadnaming??? 

> I accidentally misgendered it once and it blew it out of portion, I said I'm sorry and my was an honest mistake but that's just not good enough
> 
> Moises is not chocos deadname, if it was then why would it be public? like they wanted people to deadname them??? what trans or nonbinary person would put their deadname on the internet for the world to see and eventually let others deadname them??? dont piss me off guys... 

I've already said my apologizes to transantiradqueer and choco was never deadnamed, literally no trans or non binary person in their fucking mind would let people casually dead name them let's be honestly

If it makes you sleep comfortable at night then I'm sorry @/transantiradqueer, it was an honest mistake and i didn't know your pronouns, and when you dont know someone's pronouns you use they/them..its uhm called basic english... 

---

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS!!! 

THIS IS NOT FINISHED!!! 

I AM STILL POSTING THE UNFINISHED VERSION JUST FOR THE SAKE OF PROOF THAT I WILL APOLOGIZE 

AT THE MOMENT I AM POSTING THIS UNFINISHED BECAUSE I HAVE SCHOOL AND I NEED SLEEP SO PLEASE BE PATIENT

I WILL BE TAGGING BOTH PRO AND ANTI TAGS BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE AUDIENCES I AM TARGETING, IT IS NOT CROSS TAGGING BECAUSE I'M NOT DOING IT TO BE ANNOYING

##### Body Text
###### I had enough of your bullshit, you have some nerve and we're about to break it.
You're out of chances. I told you to fuck off. Say goodbye to your Pinterest and your TikTok threats can eat themselves, you're weak and you know it but you made this an entirely different problem now. Contacting my mutual again. Who made clear wanted you to **FUCK OFF**.

###### You contacted the same **FOURTEEN YEAR OLD** you called a child predator. "I-its the bare minimum 🥺* get your head out of your ass, the bare minimum would've been for you to have left them the FUCK ALONE and everyone else.

###### The clout you chase is from me, clamp down your piehole about everyone YOU try gamer sympathy from just because you're a perpetual pussy who tries leeching from people's audiences to prey on them.

###### From my mutuals 
###### Who YOU wished death on:

###### I ran out of patience you'll be treated as an adult predator now any TikTok fuckery you start will get your entire situation leaked including your Pinterest's destruction and any harm done to you by anyone who chooses it will be their business. You were told to **FUCK OFF**.

###### Other person you sexually harassed:

###### You fake suicide for breakfast lunch and dinner, about as much as you sexually harass people.

###### "for clicks and views" YOU'VE BEEN ONLINE LESS THAN A YEAR, GET OFF YOUR HIGH HORSE, **NO ONE KNOWS OR WANTS TO HEAR YOU FUCKING BARF ABOUT YOURSELF AND HOW  IMPORTANT YOU'RE NOT TO EVERY POPULAR BLOG YOU RUN YOUR MOUTH TO.**

###### The "unwanted negative attention" you get comes from your negative fucking actions, leeching attention from every blog and their mama, your defame, your lies, and your fuckass Harassment from problems YOU start with everyone, something the porridge you call a brain cannot grasp the basics of since you have the self awareness of a rock.

Also, you can stop pretending you could hurt anyone in your life, you'd wake up in a body bag. "T-tiktok!-" and I'd laugh at you as your TikTok friends mock your waste of an online life, or I'd deplatform you together "vents aren't good to use!" Unless it's constells receipts you use from the sexual Harassment campaign right?  "Suicide bai-" you've done nothing but weaponize your mental health against more mentally ill people, you try to be everything victim saviour and judge, you're neither victim saviour nor judge, you're a traumadumping bitch who puts victims names in their mouth for attention online, and I'm tired of your pussy life pretending anyone owes you their breath. "Kill Choco!" Do it? or get friends to try, if you can issue death threats why so safe behind a screen? Ahhh no, then you say people are "scawwed" to talk to you because they don't want you weaponize your age, which you will. To paint yourself as the victim, you can also take your "doc" threat and stick it in your mouth.

"Moises is not chocos deadname, if it was then why would it be public? like they wanted people to deadname them??? what trans or nonbinary person would put their deadname on the internet for the world to see and eventually let others deadname them??? dont piss me off guys. I've already said my apologizes to transantiradqueer and choco was never deadnamed, literally no trans or non binary person in their fucking mind would let people casually dead name them let's be honestly"

###### Piss yourself off to sleep and rot in the urine as pissed you pretend to be I'm more pissed you'll ever be, what are you gonna do, cry? newsflash, I and only I decide what is and isn't my deadmame, NOT you, fuck off. And I certainly don't let you deadmame me, that's why you got called out on it. Transantiradqueer made clear your apology was bullshit and it got debunked, the reason for my name was stated on my pinned post, not your pathetic excuses.

"you're not obliged to accept my apology" that goes without saying, shut the fuck up.
"all I ask is-" you don't ask for shit, your job is to apologize. NOT to ask or make requests, you missed the plot, you're not on stage and there's no invisible crowd to hear your monologue, many people all more relevant you'll ever be are waiting to scrape off the dirt from a book you don't belong in, your clout chasing leeching excuse for a ragebaiter does not get a say in what everyone more important then them can and will talk about, especially not in dms, whoever the fuck you think you are, you're not.
"if you ban-" I'll ban you as many times as you deserve, make a mockery out of communities you're not part of, try harass my mutuals or start putting CSA survicors' stories in your mouth as a poser who isn't one. I'll ban you, you'll deal with it, in silence, without bothering anybody else,  Tumblr staff is there for a reason. You get terminated because you break the guidelines, and you deserve it. Just because you always have an excuse in your mouth doesn't mean you are apologizing, and your every excuse gets debunked with absurd ease.
"Yet again, no need for an apology because choco lied and twisted my words, there was no sexual harassment or sexual meanings behind that ask, just a poorly done joke that I've already apologized for multiple times but choco ran out of reasons to not like me so they resorted to lying ;)" Your delusions of grandeur and misinformation don't become the lies you project by wishing it. I could make videos hour longs with receipts as to why you're objectively a detestable person, but, I think facts speak for themselves. Just because you think an excuse sounds well in your crusty mouth doesn't change the definition of sexual harassment, which you've been been to be guilty of, towards multiple people, this is not up for debate, do not insult people's intelligences to perpetuate your pisspoor deflections, everyone saw the post, if you think the 14 year old tiktoker troll non survivor is going to know about SEXUAL HARASSMENT more than a CSA survivor whose helped others overcome it for other 10 years you should stop sharing DNA with the rest of the human race, you're not worth being part of my species.
"This section doesn't need an apology rather an explanation/my thoughts on it, why I added it is to just give my opinion on why it's fucking disgusting to use vent posts against some and use posts made when someone is extremely vulnerable, it's disgusting and deplorable and downright insulting"
You don't decide what does or doesn't need an apology, for starters. Let me not hear the traumafarmer who suicide baits everyone in both ways and tries to repurpose receipts from someone's sexual harsssment campaign EVER run her mouth about what is or isn't disgusting, after fakeclaiming people's experiences and cultivate faux victimhood from her own actions, let me not entertain that fuckassery. What's beyond obscene is you having the audacity to play martyr after having such big words and big talk about victims and their experiences dealing with suicidal people and helping them out. While you tried laughing at them, you're a perpetual hypocrite who wants special treatment from everybody while not deserving to have a platform anywhere on the internet, you still do not, so you try getting one like this, an apology is about everybody else. Not you. 50% of your performance is tooting your own horn and the other 50% are excuses.
"those were cries for help, I genuinely do not feel safe at home and I do genuinely struggle with suicidal thoughts/thoughts of running away, just because it's a vent post made by someone you like doesn't mean it's bait"
So. Just because YOU don't feel "safe" at home you gotta make that everyone else's problem and make them feel unsafe, like a good little bully, is that what you're saying? Then, Cry about it, HUNDREDS of my followers deal with worse, unlike you, they don't use their backstories as shields to fling their shit at people then play victim when hit back like you do, also, your hypocrisy shines again, you dare fakeclaim people's suicide but try gamer sympathy from mental health problems you fake and weaponize against other kids you harassed, so you can guilt trip and soothe both your egoism and your victims complex, pick a fucking struggle, no, these were you talking trash about everyone who upheld their boundaries with you, and you harassing and encouraging people to report them.
"I accidentally misgendered it once and it blew it out of portion, I said I'm sorry and my was an honest mistake but that's just not good enough*

You threatened to report someone for calling you a transphobe and that's not an apology either, fuck off again.
"If it makes you sleep comfortable at night then I'm sorry @/transantiradqueer, it was an honest mistake and i didn't know your pronouns, and when you dont know someone's pronouns you use they/them..its uhm called basic english... *

🤓 "it's called basic English!" the one you lack regarding comprehension skills and literacy? no one ends an apology with "it's called basic English" you pathetic snob, oh people's sleeping comfort thankfully don't depend on how the pathological liar apologizes, you're not relevant like that.
Your apology to transantiradqueer is bullshit just like anything else that comes out of your mouth:

"Yes I've hurt people, but I was still affected too, (suicidal thoughts, being hospitalized, having to take pills) so froggo, choco, and anyone else I name owes me an apologyZ

Next: rape victim owes apologies to rapists, that's your level of ragebait, that's the gurgling bullshit blubbering up your mouth. The abuser does not plea for apologies, and you're the abuser, so keep your delusions of grandeur to yourself where they belong, unbelievably ignorant you thought anyone would buy an apology that started trying to scapegoat and cover your ass from accountability
"looking back I don't think she's actually 6, everything she did was too...well made, too well calculated, I don't know how to describe it...and I don't trust her cousin and she could've been lying but I don't know I have her blocked and she probably wouldn't care anyways. Yeah to basically make a long story fucking short, Kayla is definitely not 6...definitely older, but no one will ever know the truth tbh...¯\_(ツ)_/¯*

The SIX YEAR OLD is six regardless of your cope, and you can waddle in your waterworks about it, got it? great, because facts beat your anecdote, it doesn't matter whether you think she's six or not, her cousin has credibility that you do not, and with your level of ignorance a six year old is eloquent in contrast.

😂 ah, right! you're so pitiful you can't hurt people yourself, so you want someone else to do it, as if that wasn't MORE pathetic.
Stop sobbing about negative attention you say you get, nobody is killing you are they? the equivalent of karma? karma dictates you deserve to be about as miserable as you are, and no, everyone banning your blog isn't Harassment either, retaliatory abuse isn't abuse, retaliating against you with as much force as I please doesn't make you a victim, your cowardice doesn't make you a victim either.
"That ask wasn't sexual in anyway, choco lied and twisted my words to make me look bad and to further their victim complex*

Hey bitch, your entire post is about how you're a wallflower and a poor little victim, no one needs my help to make you look bad, you look horrible on your own, any sexual commentary in my direction is sexual Harassment, you're a minor, it was sexual Harassment, I am not asking you, you are being informed of a fact and how you digest it is not my problem.

You're pathetic for thinking you could escape with your lies. Everyone saw the post, and the receipts, everyone knows it was sexual harassment, your excuses don't matter.

You are cross-tagging regardless, being obnoxious is your default state.
I say this with my full chest, you could die and nobody here would bat an eye, stick your apology up your nose and keep making blogs I'll terminate to my leisure, you messed with people I care about and whatever happens to your ""Pinterest"" or anything you care about is irrelevant, the six year old is six your layered excuses don't matter, the call-out doc isn't bad just because it's not convenient for you to be called out, and if you ever try contact the 14 year old again you preyed on it won't just be Pinterest but any social you host that will be deplatformed, congrats, you got my attention and I don't care about being seen as the "bully" anymore, you're done, eat shit.

### Response Chain 2
#### **transantiradqueer**

Going over the part about me to show exactly why this is nothing close to an apology, and not something I will, or any trans person should degrade themself by accepting.

> "I accidentally misgendered it once"

Sure, it started out that way, but skipping past the part where Dani reacted in the exact way I anticipated they would to me being upset about being MISGENDERED (a form of fucking DEHUMANISATION), this is just untrue. Dani continued to misgender me after knowing my pronouns, even mixed in an "it/its" to show they COULD respect my pronouns, and were choosing not to.

Dismissing the weight of what you did is a classic way to belittle someone, and skip out of addressing the harm in what you did. This first line tells anyone reading how unapologetic you are since you aren't willing to say exactly what happened, condemn it, and promise to respect people.

> "and it blew it out of portion,"

I assume what you mean is "out of proportion", otherwise I'm curious what the hell this metaphor is intending to get across.

Even if I did - you tried to get me mass reported and blocked for what you even assumed was a mental health thing. As in...Remove the platform of, and support from an assumed mentally ill person, for being upset about being dehumanised.

> "I said I'm sorry"

Sure I think you mixed in a sorry - not to me, but toward someone else referencing the incident, so NOT EVEN TO *ME* - though I think it's fucking hollow. This "apology" is enough for me to assume you will never be, but I guess I'll see if you can respond decently if I show you precisely why I won't accept this, instead of you and your friend insisting I should settle for...This, and even what you pointed to as an "apology" before.

There was another thing -> "I've already said my apologizes to transantiradqueer" which I have the same response to. Not worth making a separate point about when this is right here.

> "and my was an honest mistake"

This was a valid excuse! If it weren't weaponised to continue slinging transphobia, ableism, manipulation, and general abuse/insults. That's when it becomes less of an explanation for bad behaviour, and turns into an excuse. This is an excuse.

> "but that's just not good enough"

Do I need to spell out how manipulative this is? Do I?

This whole thing goes beyond the issue of misgendering. The issue is Dani. The issue is this repeated conduct of attempted manipulation.

> "If it makes you sleep comfortable at night then I'm sorry @/transantiradqueer,"

Wow! I almost could have fallen for this if you cut the bullshit I just went over, and everything you went on to say next. It's not a nice way of saying sorry, but this, on its own, would have been way better than all of this - that's if this is even an attempt at earning my forgiveness, or is a lame attempt at damage control.

> "it was an honest mistake and i didn't know your pronouns"

This too! THIS is all you would have had to say! This tops up the last sentence into being a decent - even if it's short - apology, that I could have accepted.

> "and when you don't know someone's pronouns you use they/them.."

Ew, not the mansplaining...This is where those last two, decent sentences lost all of their "decent"ness. 

> "its uhm called basic english..."

Funny coming from you, when you're basically illiterate.

1/10 for the decent two sentences! Drop the manipulation, and insults next time if you're looking to earn anyone's forgiveness. This is filth. And if your friends have shit to say about me pointing out WHY I don't accept it this time; I expect better from you, than just reblogging anything on your side, and instead: take the responsible action of admitting this is a fucking warranted reaction considering I took the kindness to tell you, in-depth, WHY I can't accept this.

I think it's better to leave this (your post) as is, and make a separate post so people can be aware of different versions, and hopefully commend you for doing better comparatively.

That part is a suggestion, but the part before that is something that will show me you're capable of growing as a person. Otherwise, there's really no way I can ignore the blaring transphobia as any less than what it is. Do better. Be better.

I'm not nor will I ever do the following you implied??? *

##### That's DARVO, for starters, secondly **this is not a videogame to win or lose, you brainless fuck, we are not in a roleplay, get your god complex and your head out of your ass, everybody here individually despises you and you don't get the privilege of pretending they're because of a single person, everyone's got their individual reasons to, all proven your fault.**

"h-how DARE you imply my apology sucks?! I'm offended!"

Also. What the fuck is. "You should apologize for implying I was gonna call you a slur* 

##### Do you hear yourself, you piece of shit? No one says that, ever, touch grass, the fact you feign offense at the idea of being guilty is repulsive, also no, you can never win, like you said, because this isn't about you or your comfort

"also yes, you do use they/them when you dont know someone's preferred pronouns, God forbid I was trying to act respectful and not just assume you were a man or a women, how is me trying to be respectful the thing you are most offended about??? 

##### You don't know what respect is, so don't start. You've been told exactly why what you did was transphobic in the response. If you can't compute that it's entirely your fault 

Also. There's no "p-people are mad when I apologize and mad when I don't!"

##### Apologies are all about the victims, not you, your sorry excuse for an excusefest was 50% excuses and 50% tooting your own horn, this is common knowledge, but you're less developed than 5 year olds, if you actually think you can do the worst shit imaginable and an hour of deflection and a debunked apology will do anything, you're a delusional fool living in their bubble, as we all already saw 




##### You don't understand your situation at all do you? You do not get to break people's boundaries, defame their names, slight entire communities and put their names in your mouth, and try to stalk my mutuals, particularly @strawberry-fiz and expect to hide from consequences, you talked all your noise about not talking to you was. "C-choco is a pussy!- should talk to meee!" when your bluff gets called out and you're addressed directly, knowing you'll play the bullied minor card, you play the bullied minor card, pathetic,  "I just wanna make fun of proshippers!" You wanted to start problems, and didn't like when it wasn't fun anymore, you're a pisspoor playground bully gone wrong.

The only person whose twisted words and tried to lie here is you, but here all your bullshit was corrected, with evidence.

##### You want the "drama" to end? you fuck off. Away from the community and everyone you harassed, your "discomfort" doesn't matter when you break everybody else's boundaries, you should not be comfortable, and you will never be.
