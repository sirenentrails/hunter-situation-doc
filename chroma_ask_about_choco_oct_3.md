### **chromatheantishipper**
#### **Anonymous asked:**
> Why has no one told Choco to back off from Dani? They already taken down multiple accounts of Dani's and keep replying to their posts even though Dani's boundaries are clear, is this not harassment what Choco is doing or is it all Dani's fault and Choco is a saint who can do no wrong?

#### **chromatheantishipper answered:**
> We have and Choco just purposely ignores it because they're another looser on the internet that gets satisfaction from degrading others.

It's spelled loser, and the term fits all of you better than anyone else.

I don't need to respect someone who tells others to kill themselves.

Dani's boundaries don't matter when they fail to respect everyone else's, they love the attention they crave from leeching off my blog, or they'd block me and be quiet

Harassment goes both ways. If they don't want to be harassed back they can leave the internet. I'm not hearing about boundaries from someone who starts every problem with anyone they come across and cries wolf later.

Anyway! misinformation fixed. 👍

It is harassment when you keep interacting with me negatively and when I've set up a clear boundary that I don't want you near me Moises and your only proof of me breaking that is like the occasional post of me talking about you like one or twice

God can someone just travel to Spain and push you off a fucking cliff already you piss me off you clearly enable harassment and are a hypocrite

#### **You have made a mockery out of a community of survivors you don't belong in.**

#### You have continued to talk to MY mutuals despite wanting nothing to do with you. **You've spoken about me countless times because you're a clout chaser. Not once or twice.**

**You have told mutuals to kill themselves. You have sexually harassed people.**

**And now. Magically, and after YOU are confronted. Now you don't like the consequences from what you started?**

**You don't get to treat people like objects, constantly run your mouth with my name and my community, and wish death on my people then cry wolf when you're responded to, you want an out? you delete your account and leave everyone alone, you don't deserve respect, your comfort doesn't matter**.
